      <h3>Reading: Proverbs 10:11-12</h3>
      <h4>
        The mouth of the righteous is a fountain of life, but the mouth of the wicked conceals violence.
        Hatred stirs up conflict, but love covers over all wrongs.
      </h4>
      <h4>Brothers and sisters who are loved by Jesus Christ, there is an expression "your mouth is your tiger". Mouth is one of the organs of the human body that was created as part of the perfection of the body with the function of tasting, chewing and conveying words. the words uttered by the mouth show identity. and from our speech, people will hear and judge who we are. mouth if functioned properly can tell the glory of God. if misused, the mouth can convey hatred, insult, slander, vilify others, insult and curse. if the mouth functions properly, the right words will be spoken, soothing and reassuring, then the mouth will become a source of life and a blessing for us and others. from the heart can trigger speech and behavior that can lead to hatred and fights. from darkness there can be spoken love and good works that cover many transgressions. teachers and friends who are loved by God Jesus Christ, God's word at this time, reminds us to watch our mouths. the mouth used to convey constructive words becomes a source of life. a lot of time and energy is wasted because of a mouth that cannot be guarded, only talk a lot because it is stupid, stupid then it falls. Hateful words breed strife. a heart full of hate, creating a life of fighting. but there are still those who have hearts full of love, so that the transgressions are reduced, because they still cover many transgressions. teachers and friends who are loved by the Lord Jesus Christ, wherever we go, our job is to make others feel joy, therefore, let us maintain our attitude and use our mouths to enliven. keep our mouths from becoming tigers for us. Make our hearts to radiate life. The human heart mirrors that of a human. the heart sparks love that looks at others to be loved and respected. live respectfully and bring joy then we will live in the peace of God. Amen</h4>

      <h4>Let's Pray</h4>
      <h4>Father in heaven, our almighty God, glorified Your name always on earth and in heaven, all our honor and praise, only to You O Lord. We thank God for the blessing of Your gift's so that we can still exist today. At this time Lord we want to pray for Your words that we were allowed to read and hear earlier, may God's words we can understand and we practice in our lives every day. We also pray for our offerings that we were allowed to give earlier, may the offerings be used for your glory on this earth. And at this time our Lord, we want to pray for the principal, teachers, and administrative staff, Lord, may you bless them, give them strength and protect them, so that they may be able to carry out their duties and activities well. As well as for us students of Smks Christian 2 Tomohon, Please bless all of us, take care of us and protect us in our current time. At this time we often get temptations that are not pleasing to You, therefore God, may You bless us all, so that we are not affected by those temptations. We also pray for our government from the center to remote rural areas, bless them Lord, may You pour wisdom on them so that they can carry out their duties and activities well. We pray for our whole series of activities and at this time we just want to share into your loving ladder. In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ who is our light and saviour who has taught us to pray together,
